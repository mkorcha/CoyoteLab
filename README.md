# CoyoteLab

## Linux Containers for Educational Use

CoyoteLab is an exploration in the use of Linux container technology as a means to simplify the way students in computing fields access and complete laboratory work in their educational career. This project provides two main benefits: creating a simple way for students to log in and access their coursework without anything more than their web browser, and providing course instructors a way to verify that assigned work is completed successfully. CoyoteLab was inspired by services such as [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) and [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), providing an interactive way to work and learn in a web browser. However, CoyoteLab is designed specifically with an educational institution in mind, acting supplemental to a course being taught and providing ways for instructors to interact with student work more easily.

This project was created in partial fulfillment of the degree Master of Science in Computer Science at California State University, San Bernardino.
